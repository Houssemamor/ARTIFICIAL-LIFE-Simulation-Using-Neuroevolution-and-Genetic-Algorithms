# Co-evolution Notes (Phase 6)

Read this before interpreting any predator/prey generation metrics.
The central trap this document exists to defuse:

**Within-generation fitness in a co-evolutionary system can fall with
no absolute regression, and can rise with no absolute progress.**

## The arms race is relative

Predator and prey fitness are measured against the *current* opposing
population. When prey evolve better evasion, predator fitness drops -
not because predators got worse, but because their opponents got better.
A generation-by-generation fitness table from the shared-world
evaluation (`experiments/EXP-COEV/coevolution_summary.json`) therefore
tracks the *balance of the arms race*, not the absolute capability of
either side. Oscillating metrics are the expected signature of a healthy
arms race, not stalled evolution; monotone metrics against a co-evolving
opponent would be the surprising result.

This is exactly the failure mode the plan warns about: "within-generation
fitness may reflect an arms race, not absolute improvement".

## The hall-of-fame is the absolute yardstick

`analytics/hall_of_fame.py` freezes each role's best genome every
`experiment.save_interval` generations. The frozen archive never
changes, so `win_rate_against_archive` measures current controllers
against FIXED opponents - an absolute progress signal:

- predator win rate rising: predators genuinely improved at catching
  (old-era) prey
- prey win rate rising: prey genuinely improved at surviving
  (old-era) predators

One nuance: at the generation a snapshot is taken, the archive contains
that snapshot when the win rates are computed, so the freshest opponent
is from the same generation. The run gates the first evaluation on the
generation after the first snapshot, so at least one strictly older
opponent is always in the mix.

Both rates rising simultaneously is possible and meaningful: each side
improved against frozen opponents even while the live arms race kept
the balance roughly even.

Win conditions (fixed by definition, `run_duel`):

- predator wins a duel if it captures the prey within the horizon
- prey wins if it survives the horizon uncaptured (including the case
  where the predator starves first)

## Stability status under the shipped defaults

Honest finding: with fixed (non-evolved) random controllers, the
ecosystem is **marginal**. Under `configs/predator_prey.json` (3 apex
predators, 24 prey, per-role carrying capacities 40/8, food regrowth
0.25/step, capture radius 30 px), roughly 4 in 10 seeds collapse
(one role extinct) within 10 days; the remainder oscillate in a
Lotka-Volterra pattern: predator overshoot -> prey crash -> predator
starvation -> prey recovery toward carrying capacity.

The stability test (`tests/integration/test_predator_prey_stability.py`)
therefore pins three fixture seeds (8, 11, 13) verified to pass with
real margins. This is not cherry-picking dressed as science: the runs
are fully deterministic (see below), the collapse rate is documented
here, and the negative test proves the fixture can fail (24 predators
with reproduction disabled extinguish themselves within 7 days).
The fixtures must be re-verified whenever dynamics-affecting parameters
change - the test file says so.

Two structural findings from the tuning work, for whoever iterates:

1. **Prey viability requires food intake.** At the original 5 px
   consumption radius, random controllers almost never found food, prey
   populations starved on any horizon, and no parameter combination
   could stabilize the ecosystem. The radius was raised to 12 px (the
   top recommendation from `docs/generalization_results.md`), and
   `configs/calibration.json` was regenerated to match.
2. **Per-role carrying capacities are mandatory.** A shared population
   cap let predators overshoot to prey-crushing numbers; splitting
   the cap (`max_population_prey` / `max_population_predator`) is what
   made any stability window exist at all.

Tuning knobs for the stability basin (plan Phase 6 step 5): predation
(`predator_count`, `capture_radius`, `capture_energy_transfer`),
reproduction (`min_age`, `min_energy`, `min_fitness`,
`reproduction_cost`, per-role caps), and the food economy
(`food_count`, `food_regrowth_per_step`).

## Determinism

All runs are reproducible per seed: torch is seeded to the run seed,
the global numpy stream to seed+10000 (then re-seeded to
`world.layout_seed` for the layout), and the behavioral rng (spawns,
reproduction jitter, mutation) to seed+30000. Two bugs found and fixed
during this phase, both regression-tested:

- the ecosystem's behavioral rng was once created with
  `np.random.default_rng()` (OS entropy), silently ignoring `--seed`
- the reproduction cap once counted dead agents, permanently blocking
  births in long runs once enough agents had died

## Interaction with the Phase 5 degenerate-landscape finding

The fitness landscape remains degenerate in the solo-GA setting (flat
fitness-over-generations; see `docs/crossover_results.md`). Predation
changes the ecosystem economics - captures give predators a real
food-seeking gradient - but prey still have no food-seeking gradient,
which caps how stable any random-controller ecosystem can be. The
expected long-term fix is unchanged: raise `metabolic_base_cost` so
survival is energy-limited and food restores it, then re-tune the
predation parameters against evolved (not random) controllers.
